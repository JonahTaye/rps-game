rps algorithm:
first generate a random value between r p s
	* to generate random numbers we use Math.random and Math.floor
	* then if the numbers is 1 it equals rock
		if the number is 2 it equals paper
		if the number is 3 it equals scissors
	
then ask user for input between r p s: make sure the input is case insensitive
	* made inside a function named getHumanChoice
	* accepts user input using prompt
	* prompts returns the accepted value to a var
	* return the variable with the value
declare a variable that stores the score of human and computer 
play a single round of r p s
	* function name is playRound
	* accepts to param humanChoice and computerChoice
	* plays the two moves:
		human plays r p s
		computer    r p s
			equal if both are the same
			if computer is r or human is r
				if human is s or computer is s
					if human is s	
						human wins
					else
						computer wins
				if human is p or computer is p
					human loses
					computer loses
			if human is r
				if computer is s
					computer wins
				if computer is p 
					computer loses
r-p, r-s, p-s
	* increment the scores of humanScore and computerScore based on the winner
play a game 5 times

rps is this is ohow it goses

assume if they are both equal they tie 
human choice and computer choice:
       rock > scissors
       rock < paper

       paper > rock
       paper < scissors

       scissors > paper
       scissors < rock

else if (humanChoice == "rock" || computerChoice == "rock") {
        if (humanChoice == "paper") {
            console.log("You win!! Paper beats Rock")
            humanScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "paper") {
            console.log("You lose!! Paper beats Rock")
            computerScore += 1
        } else if (humanChoice == "scissors") {
            console.log("You lose!! Rock beats Scissors")
            computerScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "scissors") {
            console.log("You win!! Rock beats Scissors")
            humanScore += 1
        }
    } else if (humanChoice == "paper" || computerChoice == "paper") {
        if (humanChoice == "rock") {
            console.log("You lose!! Paper beats Rock")
            computerScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "rock") {
            console.log("You win!! Paper beats Rock")
            humanScore += 1
        } else if (humanChoice == "scissors") {
            console.log("You win!! Scissors beats Paper")
            humanScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "scissors") {
            console.log("You lose!! Scissors beats Paper")
            computerScore += 1
        }
    } else if (humanChoice == "sicssors" || computerChoice == "sicssors") {
        if (humanChoice == "paper") {
            console.log("You lose!! Scissors beats Paper")
            computerScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "paper") {
            console.log("You win!! Scissors beats Paper")
            humanScore += 1
        } else if (humanChoice == "rock") {
            console.log("You win!! Rock beats Scissors")
            humanScore += 1
        } else if (computerChoice == "scissors") {
            console.log("You lose!! Rock beats Scissors")
            computerScore += 1
        }
    }

human wins
    human rock and computer scissors or human paper and computer is scissors or human is scissors and computer is rock
else
    computer wins

playing the game 5 times    
    * function name playGame
    * move score variables and playRound inside this function
    * call this function 5 times using loop
        loop starts at 0 goes it before it reachs 5
        each iteration calls playRound func

version 2 of rps
code seems well written but the ui needs imporvement so how do we do that
    - a title that says Welcome to the rps game
    - it might then say you are battling against the computer
    - first one to 5 wins good luck
    - below that pick the weapon of your choice
    - then we will have three divs with images
        * an image of a rock look for a cartoon icon or svg image with a text that says "Rock"
        * same type of image of a paper crumbled that says "Paper"
        * same type of image of a scissor that says "Scissors"
    - then we will have the score card below that
        * it will have the title Round (current round)
        * then an avatar of a human and the score next to it
        * also an image of a cartoon monitor that has the score next to it

a color scheme of blue found in the odin project and a light yellow
also needs to have better fonts
